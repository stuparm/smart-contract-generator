# smart-contract-generator

This project shows the posibility to use simple programming tools (like [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/)) for smart contract creation. In following months, I will publish the **generator** so everyone (even kids) will be able to start writting blockchain applications.


#### SAP Blockchain

This is the first example that shows smart contract (chaincode) creation for [SAP Blockchain Service](https://www.sap.com/products/leonardo/blockchain.html)
